Changes:
- Redesigned layout
- "Name (POST key)" now supports multiple name fields separated by commas
- Added search bar in the History tab for easier file tracing
- Added "Edit code" and "Save changes" in the "View Code" modal for final code edits
- Added automatic Docu if/else conditions: name any Docu checkbox with "Docu" in the name/id so it is added to the generated conditions automatically
- For Docu fields with "hidden" checked, the output no longer includes "<input type=\"checkbox\" checked disabled />"
